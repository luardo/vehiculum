# Vehiculum prototype

by: Luis Eduardo Gamero

## Summary

The following prototype contains only the HTML structure and CSS with SCSS

This project has been created following an Atomic Design approach in which we have reusable components.

Come reusable components:

- Navigation
- Button
- Banner

## Responsive Design

The page can be viewed in iphones, however, it wasn't based on any mockup. I have only adjusted some UI which I consider would made sense.
It is possible to implement more responsivness and features but I was lacking some time.
